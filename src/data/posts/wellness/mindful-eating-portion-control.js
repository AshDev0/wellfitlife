        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">

      <!-- Section 1 -->
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">What is Mindful Eating?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Mindful eating means being fully present while you eat—paying attention to your food, your hunger signals, and how your body feels. It's the opposite of eating while scrolling through your phone, watching TV, or working on your laptop.
        </p>
        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 my-6">
          <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-900">Key Principle:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you're satisfied (not stuffed).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why Mindful Eating Works for Weight Loss</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg">
          <li><strong>Prevents overeating:</strong> You become aware of when you're full</li>
          <li><strong>Reduces emotional eating:</strong> You eat based on hunger, not boredom or stress</li>
          <li><strong>Improves digestion:</strong> Eating slowly helps your stomach process food better</li>
          <li><strong>No food guilt:</strong> You enjoy your meals without feeling bad about what you eat</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Simple Mindful Eating Habits You Can Start Today</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">1. Eat Without Distractions</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Put away your phone, turn off the TV, and focus on your meal. When you eat mindlessly, you consume more calories without realizing it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">2. Chew Slowly (At Least 20-30 Times Per Bite)</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Your brain takes about 20 minutes to register that you're full. Chewing slowly gives your body time to send those signals.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">3. Use Smaller Plates</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
          This simple trick makes your portions look bigger, so you feel satisfied with less food.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">4. Drink Water Before Meals</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger. Drink a glass of water 10-15 minutes before eating to avoid overeating.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">5. Ask Yourself: "Am I Really Hungry?"</h3>
        <p class="text-lg">
          Before grabbing a snack, pause and check if you're truly hungry or just bored, stressed, or tired.
        </p>
